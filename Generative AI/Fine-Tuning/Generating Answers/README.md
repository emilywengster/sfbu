The overall process of working with input texts, embeddings, vectors, and search index involves the following steps:
    -Step 1: Generate Embeddings from Input Texts
        In this step, you convert input texts into numerical embeddings using pre-trained models or embedding techniques.
    -Step 2: Create Vectors from Embeddings
        After obtaining embeddings for input texts, you generate vectors that represent these embeddings in a vector space.
    -Step 3: Create Search Index from Vectors
        In this step, the vectors derived from embeddings are used to create a search index.
        The search index organizes and stores these vectors for efficient retrieval.
