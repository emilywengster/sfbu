Web Crawler and Q&A Bot

This project is a web-based application that crawls a website, generates embeddings for the crawled content, and answers questions based on that content using OpenAI’s GPT-based model. The app is built using Flask, and it integrates Python scripts to crawl a website, generate embeddings, and perform question-answering.
Google Slide is also uploaded for steps
